Foundations first

List of needed things for Tetris:
1. Setup the 7 tetrominoes to interact with along with initial board state
Lots of arrays are required. Looking into other grid-like such as chess could give me an idea on how to draw tetris.
2. Figure out the clockwise or counter-clockwise rotation of standard Tetris
3. How to advance game state: lower the selected tetromino 1 line after a brief interval
4. Figure out how to register collision with other pieces and the game walls
5. Keep tetromino placement and get the next piece
6. Register and clear completed rows

To-do:
